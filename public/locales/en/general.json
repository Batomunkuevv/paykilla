It&nbsp;handles the technical aspects of&nbsp;blockchain transactions, verifying and processing payments in&nbsp;digital currencies such as&nbsp;BTC and ETH. Gateways integrate with websites or&nbsp;e-commerce platforms, offering lower fees and faster processing than traditional payment methods."

                    "question": "What are the benefits of&nbsp;using a&nbsp;cryptocurrency payment service?",
                    "answer": "Cryptocurrency payment services (gateways) significantly reduce transaction fees (typically less than&nbsp;1% compared to&nbsp;2-5% for traditional processors), providing faster settlements in&nbsp;minutes rather than days. They eliminate chargeback fraud through irreversible blockchain transactions and provide global accessibility without the complexities of&nbsp;currency conversion. In&nbsp;addition, offering cryptocurrency payments positions your business as&nbsp;innovative and progressive one in&nbsp;an&nbsp;increasingly digital economy."

                    "question": "How does<br> PayKilla work?",
                    "answer": "When a&nbsp;customer selects a&nbsp;cryptocurrency at&nbsp;the checkout stage, PayKilla&nbsp;generates a&nbsp;unique payment address for the transaction. The customer sends the exact amount from his wallet and&nbsp;PayKilla verifies correctness of&nbsp;the transaction. Business can choose to&nbsp;receive payments in&nbsp;multiple cryptocurrencies or&nbsp;automatically convert to&nbsp;one preferred currency, with&nbsp;PayKilla dashboard providing real-time monitoring and reporting."

                    "answer": "Yes, PayKilla&nbsp;implements advanced security measures including advanced encryption, multi-signature authentication and real-time fraud detection systems. Unlike traditional payment systems that are vulnerable to&nbsp;data breaches, PayKilla&rsquo;s decentralised architecture minimises exposure to&nbsp;common security threats."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How to&nbsp;start<br> using the service?",
                    "answer": "Getting started with&nbsp;PayKilla requires you to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;account for your business. Once registered, customise your payment preferences and integrate using the API or&nbsp;use the out-of-the-box widget solution. This is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;start accepting cryptocurrency payments without connection fees or&nbsp;technical hurdles."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Does the service<br> charge a&nbsp;connection fee?",
                    "answer": "No, PayKilla&nbsp;does not charge any connection fees, unlike many traditional payment processors and other cryptocurrency gateways. This zero fee policy makes accepting cryptocurrency affordable for businesses of&nbsp;any size with no&nbsp;upfront costs or&nbsp;hidden setup fees."
                },

                    "question": "How do&nbsp;businesses integrate cryptocurrency into their existing payment system?",
                    "answer": "PayKilla&nbsp;integrates seamlessly along with your existing payment methods via special plugins or&nbsp;APIs. The integration adds cryptocurrency as&nbsp;a&nbsp;payment option without changing the existing payment process, while the dashboard consolidates reporting across all payment methods."
